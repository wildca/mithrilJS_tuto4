Many examples may be run without the server. Just run the HTML file.

Others require the node.js server.
You can install it from ```http://nodejs.org/```.

Start the server with ```node app.js``` and point your
browser to ```http://localhost:3000/public/FormMixin.html``` for example.

or you may use the front-end packaging tool
[component] (https://github.com/component/component).

#### Occlusion components

Occlusion implementations helps you implement efficient components that render 
only what is visible on the screen. 
They are useful for large tables, large lists, infinite scrolling, 
deferring rendering of below-the-fold content, and parallax sites.

- [```occlusionList```](/components/occlusionList) - Simple list, rendering only what is visible.
[(readme)](/components/occlusionList)
- [```occlusionTable```](/components/occlusionTable) - Table which scrolls vertically and horizontally.
Optional header rows always displayed. Pinned columns always appear.
Responsive to width changes from CSS media queries.
[(readme)](/components/occlusionTable)

## Mixins
Mixin ```ValidationMixin``` resides in ```mixins/ValidationMixins/```.
Docs are in the ```readme```.
A working example, if any, is located at ```public/ValidationMixin.html```.

- ```mixins/Solder.js``` - A simple dependency injector for mixins. 
Mixin extension is supported.
- ```Solder-extend``` - Extending a mixin with new features.
- ```ValidationMixin``` - A data validator, for one field or the entire form. 
Can be used to display error messages as user is entering data, e.g. onchange. 
Integrated with [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js).
- ```FormMixin``` - Adds support for forms, with or without a < form >.
Example requires the server.

## Patterns
Pattern ```seo-by-cleanup``` resides in ```patterns/seo-by-cleanup.js``` .
A working example, if any, is located at ```public/seo-by-cleanup.html```

### Basic

- ```service-error-handling``` - Handle web-server and app errors

### Services - just throwing things inline for now 

- ```progress bars``` - How to show a progress bar.

```
var Thing = {
  list: function(options) {
    return m.request({method: "GET", url: "/thing", config: function(xhr) { xhr.onprogress = options.progress }})
  }
}
Thing.list({progress: function(e) { console.log("progress: ", e) }})
```
- ```run m.request in background``` - Do not wait for completion to trigger an update of the view.
https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/pull/62
```
m.request({method: "GET", url: "/foo", background: true})
    .then(m.redraw); //force redraw
```
- ```abort request ``` - Abort a running request (https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/63)
```
var transport = m.prop();
m.request({method: "GET", url: "/foo", config: transport}); // transport <- xhr
transport().abort();
```

#### More obscure

- ```attach XHR to m.request promise chain``` - (https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/63)
```
function requestWithXhr(options) {
  var xhr
  options.config = function(x) {xhr = x};
  var req = m.request(options);
  req.xhr = xhr;
  return req;
}
ChainedAndXhrPromise(requestWithXhr(args))
  .then(foo)
  .then(bar)
  .xhr.agawjkgahwjkg
```

### SEO / server rendered first page

- ```seo-by-noscript``` - Server serves SEO the first page within a noscript tag.
- ```seo-by-cleanup``` - Remove server generated DOM so Mithril can re-render the first page.
- One [Proof of concept] (https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/issues/60#issuecomment-41177111)
for Mithril itself to handle this efficiently.
